This contract defines a Voting contract that allows registered voters to vote on proposals and checks whether a proposal has passed. The contract consists of four main components:

Voter: A struct that represents a registered voter and keeps track of whether they have voted and the ID of the proposal they voted for.
Proposal: A struct that represents a proposal and keeps track of its description and the number of votes it has received.
chairperson: An address that represents the chairperson who is responsible for adding proposals and registering voters.
proposals: An array of Proposal structs that holds the proposals that can be voted on.
The contract defines three main functions:

addProposal: A function that adds a new proposal to the proposals array. Only the chairperson can add a proposal.
registerVoter: A function that registers a voter. Only the chairperson can register voters.
vote: A function that allows a registered voter to vote on a proposal. The function checks whether the voter is registered, whether they have already voted, and whether the proposal has already passed. If the proposal receives more than half of the votes, the function emits a ProposalPassed event.
Overall, this contract demonstrates how Solidity can be used to build a decentralized voting system that ensures fairness and transparency.
